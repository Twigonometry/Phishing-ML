About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, \nand most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part \nof Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or \nnationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.\nIn 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the \nRev.

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141c9e,"\nhttp://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtmlDear Garrison,There are at least six plans about what to do with\n""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\nchildren's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\nWhat do you think should done with the space?Joe Adams\nHillsdale, New JerseyI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\nthat's designed by committee and that's gone through\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\nand that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\ntowers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\nhistorical museums and in New York there's barely a\nlittle plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.\nIt's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141ca2,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the\nstandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\nworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\nimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\nfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\nof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\nrecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\nwhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\nnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\nMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\nUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\nftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\ncapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\nnot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\nstill hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\nmessage.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed\nat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\nhost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\navailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\nolder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\ndecode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\nthat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\nlimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\nencoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the\nmessage transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME?The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via\nanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: \n                                                       \n     o  US East Coast                            \n        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        \n                                                        \n     o  US West Coast                            \n        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      \n                                                        \n     o  Pacific Rim                              \n        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  \n                                                        \n     o  Europe                                   \n        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txtAnother source of information is the Internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"",\nwhich includes a periodic posting of a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" list.--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jason \nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside \njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \ngeneral) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's \nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. _Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is â€œthe format \nformerly known as RSSâ€. Sam has already implemented it[5]. _Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. â€œAre you also fed up with the continuing war \nbetween RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. \nSo today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It \nisn't RDF. It's just data.â€ Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type \ndoesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an \nimpediment to mainstream acceptance. _Shelley Powers_: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. â€œI'm not buying into RSS \n0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my \nRSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:â€     *RSS not supported here*     This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0.

OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,\naccordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as\nthe code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0bSo, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that\nwere not there before the branch:  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too\n    lax and caused FPs  - Matt's faster HTML parser  - commented rules un-commented again  - a doco fix for spamd\nand, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:  - the INSTALL file ;)  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary  - Added examples to -R docs\n  \n  - Added Habeas HIL lookup  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.\n    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com\n    (Christopher Davis) applied.  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,\n     fixes bug 655  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file\n    with -u arg  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been\n    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users\n    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger\n    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on\n    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code\n    catch additional types of web bugs  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid\n    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer\n    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move\n    them to the compensation file))  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html\n    were triggering.  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing\n    any nonspam matches)  - raise some negative scores that are way too low  - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND\n    and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much  - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of\n    different eval functions needed for HTML tests--j.-- \n'Justin Mason' => { url => http://jmason.org/ , blog => http://taint.org/ }\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

BackgroundThe Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of\nits filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them\nover the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is\nbuilt on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.II.  Problem DescriptionA part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC\nmessages had an error which, when the server received a message with a\nzero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the\nprevious message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would\nlater cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server\ncode which tried to traverse the chain.III. ImpactCertain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages\nin some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up\nwhen such clients connect.An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD\nsystem can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause\nthe target system to lock up.IV.  Workaround1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""\n   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the\n   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes\n   should suffice.2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from\n   untrusted hosts.V.

A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054Â° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28Â° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23Â° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05Â° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR. JOHN CHRISTYChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an ""invited key contributor"" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.DR. ROY SPENCERSpencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.BIBLIOGRAPHY(1) J.R. Christy, 1995, ""Climatic Change,"" Vol. 31, pp. 455-474.(2) J.R. Christy, R.W. Spencer and R.T.

The new\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\nchurch.\nNevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\n""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\ndown,"" it said.\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\nDr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\n""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\nsociety's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\nis present.\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\nevangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\nA letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the\nevangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\nteaching.\nOn the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption\nand blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""\n------------------------ Yahoo!

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141d3b,"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> What is the GPL all about then?(1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything\non a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU\nGPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware\nthat XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl\nArtistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that\nnumerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and\na whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any\nopen source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the\nGPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that\n_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you\nmay insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source\ncode.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights\nwhatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!Again, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite\nconfident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's\nsource-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their\ndistribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms\nto someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any\nreasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.\n \n> Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp\n> version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy\n> and giving it to me?See below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.\nSuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you\ndown to a judge, if that's what you're asking.> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not\n> asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to\n> burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable\n> consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a\n> couple of pints?).You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted\nwork to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if\nyou've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather\nimprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works\nunder diverse licence terms collected onto some media.In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate\nand redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the\napplications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are\nproprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,\nduplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is\ncopyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the\nGNU GPL is going to change that.(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and\n""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for\nvalue"".)If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.> What does the GPL mean now?Suggestion:  Read it.

( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal\n 2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal .\n 3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project .\n under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay .\n from an enron perspective :\n the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa\n while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project .\n if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings\n the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits .\n it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value .\n tod\n - - - - - original message - - - - -\n from : presto , kevin m .\n sent : saturday , september 15 , 2001 2 : 41 pm\n to : curry , mike ;

( source :\n company website ) currently trading at . 012\n possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has\n started and is expected to last all week .\n imagine how well your

promoted , making a very large number of\n investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp !\n let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\n otc : dmxp\n about the company :\n delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\n company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\n ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\n located over what management considers to be some of the most\n prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\n another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\n controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\n that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\n found in north america .\n the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\n rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\n company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\n experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\n most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\n the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\n market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\n with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\n minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\n along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\n extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\n moves forward .\n among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\n years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\n south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\n corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\n drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california .\n delta has experienced significant technical success since its\n start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\n in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\n kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\n of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\n the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\n minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\n diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene .\n an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\n discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\n under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\n kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada .\n in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\n prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\n group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\n one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\n the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\n comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\n all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\n exploration is justified .\n delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\n its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\n by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\n identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\n companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\n finance additional exploration .\n in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\n controls , they also control a gold property with great potential .\n the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\n revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\n extensive exploration program .\n ( source : company website )\n recent headlines : go online and read

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered !

"" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts\n",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

press , cambridge mass . , 160 pages , isbn 0-262 - 70066 - 2 , $ 12 . 50 ( paperback ) . reviewed by anne reboul , loria-cnrs , france . anne . reboul @ loria . fr 0 . introduction ter meulen 's book is a good introduction to the work which she has been doing during the past few years on both the representation of eventualities and temporal reasoning . the book combines her approach 's desire not to lose information previously given in discourse with semantic principles which are squarely based on situation semantics . this allows her to introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , which can loosely be described as temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points out that , though common sense reasoning plays an important role in temporal reasoning , it is not her aim to deal with it . finally the present paperback edition of the book incorporates an appendix giving some exercises on dat construction and a short account of the resemblance and difference between drt and dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims to account for the linguistic and informational balance between static and dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative to tense and aspect and using tools derived from situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes the world as being composed of two main types of temporal objects : events which introduce changes and states which do not . this linguistic capacity is accompanied by an inferential ability in interpretation of what is or is not the case when . ter meulen deals only with the simple past , the perfect , the progressive and some uses of the present , that is with tenses which indicate in which order events occur , through weak constraints on the temporal relations between events . the difference between the simple past and the perfect is aspectual , as is obvious when they are examined in the light of the difference between events and states : the simple past describes events in a context-dependent way while the perfect only gives stative information . aspect can be seen as imposing control on the flow of information and here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters and plugs which are closely related , respectively , to vendler 's classical ontological classes of activities ( "" john ran for half an hour "" ) , accomplishments ( "" john built a house "" ) and achievements ( "" john won the race "" ) . ter meulen introduces the notion of situated reasoning about time : according to her , there is a temporal vantage point in a text from which reasoning about the text can proceed . this is the first ( descriptive ) factor . the second ( aspectual ) factor is the source of information , while the third factor is perspective information . new temporal information is processed against a context ( the given ) which incorporates at least the lexicon and syntax of the language , situated and logical inference rules , other semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , the available information and the elements of the situation of use . 2 . the aspectual verbs the aspectual verbs describe the internal structure of events and are , in english , "" start "" , "" begin "" , "" commence "" , "" initiate "" , "" resume "" ( for event beginnings ) , "" continue "" , "" keep "" ( for event middles ) and "" end "" , "" finish "" , "" terminate "" , "" halt "" , "" cease "" , "" complete "" ( for event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing the middle or the end of an event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions about the previous existence not of an event , but of this event ) . aspectual verbs describing the onset of an event semantically have an indefinite and existential character . verbs describing the middle of an event are quantificational verbs and holes . verbs describing the ending of events may be filters or plugs depending on whether they can be finished ( plugs ) or ended ( holes ) . there are pairs of aspectual verbs linked by a semantic contrary relation , such as "" start / finish "" , "" stop / resume "" , "" resume / finish "" , "" keep / end "" , "" continue / end "" . in dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted of individuals , their relations and a positive or negative polarity . events can be classified in similarity classes or types based on their parts . a type consists in a relation , objects and a positive or negative polarity , indicating whether the relation holds or does not hold between the objects . types can also include parameters or indeterminate objects and can be used for any constituent apart from polarities . a given situation supports the type if it matches with its constituents . for types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends on the existence in the situation of some objects corresponding to the parameter and satisfying both the relation and the polarity . aspectual verbs can also be described in terms of their monotonicity : if inferences , for a given aspectual verbs , are valid from smaller parts to larger parts , the verb is monotone increasing , while if inferences are valid from larger parts to smaller parts , the verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen then proposes the aspectual cube , that is a cube allowing the representation of the relations between aspectual verbs as well as of their monotonicity properties . each vortex in the cube has two vertical arrows of which the first represents the dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while the second represents the increasing ( upward arrow ) or decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . the cube visualizes the dynamic transitions beginning with + start ; and stopping with "" end "" or "" finish "" . its bottom corresponds to stative holes , while its top corresponds to dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations of arrows in english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips the left arrow changing the dynamicity , while internal negation flips the right arrow . finally , there is an arrow kinematics , whereby the combinations of arrow given above gives a dynamic or stative aspect , this being always determined by the right arrow ( i . e . the value of the combination is always the value of the right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are a way of graphically representing information about events in directed graphs where nodes , labeled with descriptive information , can be either holes or plugs . each dat has a unique source node ( a plug ) , which is the rightmost terminal node , corresponding to the utterance event and determining the perspective . any information in the past tense has preceded the source and is represented by nodes on a branch to the left of it . present information include the source . thus left-to - right order represents the flow of time while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used for temporal reasoning about the past ( though they do not allow modalities and counterfactuals ) . there is also in a dat a single root node , dominating all the other nodes , including the source , and representing the entire episode described . there is also a current node , which is the last constructed one and which can opened ( hole ) or closed ( plug ) , this property determining how the next information will be processed . if the current node is a plug , the new information will be represented as a new node descending from one of the current node 's parent nodes , usually the lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce new nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses with "" have "" and progressive clauses are introduced as stickers on the current node , if it is a plug , or on the next node , if it is a hole . stickers are portable and can be transmitted to new nodes when the dat grows . introducing a new node independent of the current one indicates a change in perspective . a path connecting a set of labeled nodes to the root is a chronoscope and the current chronoscope is the one containing the current node . compatibility relations ( which are symmetric , reflexive and transitive ) are determined both lexically and through the entailment relations between types on the same chronoscope . the notion of chronoscope is one of the main device of temporal reasoning in dats , allowing for persistence , i . e . the preservation of information . however , temporal reasoning depends on the current node , the search for a conclusion starting at the current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather than linguistic expressions and , as such they follow semantic rules . they are interpreted in event structures into which they are embedded and which allow temporal reasoning if they obey semantic constraints . interpretability for a text depends on the possibility of constructing a dat which can be embedded in an event structure obeying these constraints . an embedded dat describes an episode if the event structure in which it is embedded provides values for it . a text is true if the episode described in the dat is part of the world . 4 . states , generic information and constraints stative information are always represented as stickers on nodes in dats , but some states are more permanent than others , this difference being represented as portability conditions in perspective shifts . there are thus rules for downward portability conditions of stickers and for portability conditions for accommodation . portability conditions differ for perfect states and for progressive states . generic stative information is also represented by stickers and can be imported upward depending on whether the property is predicated under default to the members of a given category or on whether it is predicated of the category itself rather than of its members and on whether it appears in conditionals or under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives a dat gives a certain perspective on the episode it describes and the same episode may be described in different dats , each giving a different perspective on it . this means that dats on the same episode can lead to different conclusions . changes of perspective depend on the rule used for the updating : hole or sticker rules do not change the perspective , plug or filler rules do . in other words , changes of chronoscope correspond to changes of perspective and depend on the status of the current node . there is , however , more to perspective than just creating a new chronoscope when updating the dat : the other possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds to the unplugging of a plug which turns it into a hole , allowing the addition of new information under it . the notion of perspective is strongly dependent on the compatibility of information or , more generally , on coherence and it is one of the merits of dat to allow for a more precise content to the rather slippery notion of coherence , relying on the rules for dat construction and the notion of chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond to flashbacks and consist of three operations : unplugging nodes in old chronoscopes , resetting the current node to an old one and making the existing nodes and the new nodes just added independent though they are dominated by the same ancestor . ter meulen proposes a tentative definition of such a flashback process . she notes that perspective allows perspective binding of np anaphora and proposes a perspective constraint to deal with it . finally ter meulen outlines the possibility of three-dimensional dats , the third dimension allowing for the representation of independent structures of nodes , though communality of the root is preserved . such three dimensional dats would be called scenarios though each part of such dats with a unique source would still describe an episode . parts of scenarios which incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . a fragment of english in this chapter , ter meulen gives a syntactic and semantic account of a fragment of english , as "" a laboratory environment for the theory of interpretation "" ( 93 ) , as well as a recapitulation of the rules for dat construction and updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow for the simultaneous encoding of three types of information : aspectual control of information through the open / closed property of nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , and descriptive information through the types labeling the nodes . dats are compatible with aristotelian realism as defined by barwise and perry , that is , with the view that the structure of information depends on the natural world . a distinction should be made , according to ter meulen between interpreting an utterance to extract the information it contains and evaluating the truth-value of that information . appendix in this appendix which has been added in the paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises on dat construction as well as a comparison between drt and dats . i will only comment on that second part of the appendix . as ter meulen notes , dats stems partly from drt . nevertheless and though dat logic is not developed enough to allow for a complete comparison , there are quite a few differences between them : dats account for inference from simple past to past perfect or progressive , for portability conditions of stative information in chronoscopes and for aspectual verbs , which drt does not ; drt accounts for temporal adverbials and for temporal interpretation of subordinate clauses , which dats do not ; dats substitute the notion of current chronoscope to the notion of temporal reference point used in drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference as depending crucially from the current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , as logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original and interesting . it must be read by anyone interested in time , tense and aspect . all the criticisms which can be leveled against it come from one reason : the fact that the book is much too short . this means that though it is clear enough , it is rather difficult to read . it is also quite frustrating in that , for instance , though ter meulen does explain how to construct dats ( in chapter 3 ) and gives detailed rules , there is not enough step by step examples of dats in the book ( as for example , there was in kamp and reyle 1993 ) . in much the same way , one would have liked to have a much more detailed comparison with alternative accounts , such as drt , the parsonian account of events or , more generally , aktionsart . the appendix , which has been added in the paperback edition ( 1997 ) and which did not exist in the first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is not really enough to satisfy both of these complaints . ter meulen 's book hints about a relation between reference to objects and reference to time ( the indefiniteness of the argument nps of a given verb may influence the interpretation of the clause , and , notably , aspect ) . all of these hints are very interesting and , again , a longer book might have given the author more scope to develop those intuitions . thus one can only hope that this interesting book will be followed by a bigger one , in which dat logic could be developed more fully , contrasted with alternative approaches and where ter meulen could describe more precisely her suggestions regarding perspective and the interaction between the semantic aspect in dats and the commonsense reasoning whose necessity she acknowledges but which she does not deal with in her book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published at the same time as pustejovsky 's work on the lexicon , thus she does n't make use of pustejovsky 's system . it would be nice to know if an intersection between these approaches can be made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .

"" * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked "" objects . "" * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are "" identical "" in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form "" equivalance "" classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template "" objects "" consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template "" relations "" consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc -

( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to "" show "" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ?

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141dd6,"Subject: feminine-he , singular-they\n \n content - length : 8133 dear language scholars . i am presenting the following material as a discussion item . one of my ultimate purposes is to contribute to the revised oed due out in 2005 . for a paper i am currently working on , i ' m requesting comments and contributions . a summary will be forthcoming . feminine-he and singular-they mine is a new set of explanations for the two most regularly discussed grammatical oddities of english : indefinite / proverbial he and singular they . ( i will also touch on them and their . ) the orthodox view of pronoun history ( for she , they , them , their ) involves the north-to - south "" wave theory , "" as stated as early as 1866 by richard morris . it is the theory that is set forth in the oed and has never been questioned . the feminine h - stem , according to this accepted view , was displaced in the language in a wave of cultural diffusion when the feminine pronunciation began to approximate that of the masculine pronoun in the 12th and 13th centuries . the other pronouns discussed here also involved the north-to - south waves of diffusion . my contention is that the significant cause for the historical replacement of these pronouns ( except for the h - stem subject plural ) was the standardizing force exerted by the printing press - - it happened rather quickly - - not waves of cultural diffusion over centuries . in my analysis of the seventeen manuscripts of the a - version of piers plowman , the h - stem feminine is found with great regularity . how can this be explained ? in many lines , the occurrences in the manuscripts of h - stem feminines outnumber the sh - forms found in the same lines . many manuscripts use both forms . the manuscripts are copies of copies of copies . on the bases of the manuscripts that have been dated , i place the "" average "" manuscript within a few generations of the advent of printing . my explanation , perhaps the anglo - norman rulers had a predilection for a distinction in the masculine / feminine singular . while the folk generally used the bi-gendric "" egalitatian "" h - stem form in the vernacular , the more politically correct sh - form was preferred at oxford / cambridge , in proper social etiquette , and in writing when referring to a "" lady . "" when caxton began his enterprise , the sh - form ( as well as the others spoken of here ) became enforced as the correct form through the great power of the press . and the h - stem feminine remained known in the spoken language , alongside the sh - form , well beyond printing . it had not dropped from speech and become archaic by 1300 . when the "" prescriptive "" grammarians prescribed indefinite-he , this h - stem still carried in its semantic domain a bi-gendric reference . although the seventeen manuscripts of piers is my main corpus of evidence , there are various kinds of other evidence to support my theory for the late survival of the h - stem feminine in the colloquial of the middle ages . one of the more interesting is the existence of the h - stem feminine in gullah ( when and if west african origins are discounted ) . other supporting evidence can be found in various places in the oed . it is scanty and scattered , but nonetheless there . h - stem and sh - form feminines existed for centuries , side by side , as formal and informal , although , for sure , in many cases the distinction was lost . "" hi was a fair wifman "" is found in the mid - 14th century agenbite of inwyt ( i am currently translating this work ) . in it , the pronunciation of the feminine pronoun is the same as the modern masculine ! ( the vowel had not yet diphthongized ) . the supposition that this h - stem is a "" literary form , "" as suggested by the oed ( presumably this means copied in manuscript from an earlier exemplar ) is untenable because the agenbite was translated directly from french . i have extracted the pronoun paradigms from all the manuscripts of the a - version of piers . in addition to the great evidence for the wide use of the h - stem feminine centuries beyond its supposed demise , the h - stem plural ( although extremely rare ) can also be found ( in line prologue 63 it is used to satisfy alliteration ! ) . and in every manuscript of piers the h - stem obliques ( modern them and their ) are to be found ( often alongside the th - forms ) . and then , in a generation after printing , the h - stems for she , they , them , and their seem to vanish ! ! , at least from the written evidence . the h - stem feminine held wide currency in the colloquial of the middle ages and therefore , supported by other evidence , was not unknown to the prescriptive grammarians a few centuries later . the accepted theory that the h - stem feminine dropped from the language before 1300 , prior to the time the poem "" alysoun "" was written , is in need of revision . piers shows it to have been very much alive in the 15th century . an explanation for the replacement of the h - stem plural nominative by they , a replacement occurring earlier than the other pronouns in question , has never been proposed . would n't there have been pressure for some alternative to the oe h - stem subject plural as a result of the disappearance of the preterit plural during this period ? because the english verb lost its marker in the preterit for number , the h - stem plural ( which shared the same form with the feminine singular nominative ) became in some contexts ambiguous for number . a new form was needed . although a norse form may have reinforced it among northern speakers , there was a native singular form available from the same set of oe demonstratives that gave us the . the and they appear to be duplets . if this is so , then the singular morphology of they is in fact historical and has been alive in the colloquial for a very long time ! ! the , in oe a singular , developed as a singular / plural ( the car / cars ) , extended to the accusative , but lost its absolute ( stand-alone ) use . they , retaining the pronunciation of oe the , was restricted to the nominative , and became the unambiguous written plural by 1400 - - but in the colloquial it retained also its singular morphology . later , in regard to them and their , caxton used the th - forms as the unambiguous plurals because the h - stems for these pronouns had throughout england a tremendous diversity of forms . for example , in one ( written ) dialect her would be a feminine / singular / possesive , in another it would be an all-genders / plural / possesive . caxton needed forms that would be universally understood , hence the written th - form obliques replaced the h - stems in an historic blink of the eye - - not in a wave of cultural diffusion that coincidentally wafted through london at the time caxton set up his print shop . a well supported case can be made for the late survival of the h - stem feminine , into the 15th century , and hence a case for its cultural currency at the time of the prescriptive grammarians . if this is so , the exclusion of one gender from "" cognitive space "" would not apply , and hence the motives of these grammarians would have to be reassessed . if in fact the sapir - whorf hypothesis does apply to pronouns , then i invite comment to help me understand two facts . 1 ) that for two-thirds of the history of english the subject pronoun used to refer to a group of men / boys was a form that was identical to the feminine singular ; and 2 ) the expression by a pronoun of "" possessing "" something by men / boys was also for two-thirds of the history of english expressed by a form that was morphologically marked for feminine but not masculine .\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141dde,"Subject: genetic classification\n \n i wish to make some comments on an issue that recent discussion of nostratic and the problem of "" demonstrating "" distant genetic relationships has skirted around that i believe underlies some of the issues that various people have been directly addressing . an assumption that seems to underly much of the discussion is that hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are not interesting unless they can be proven to be true . i find this a rather odd assumption , and one that does not seem to be made about any other kinds of hypotheses in linguistics ( or anywhere else in science as far as i know ) . and let us set aside for the sake of argument the oft-noted point that the notion of proof is not really applicable to empirical hypotheses , and assume that the term is to be used loosely for some arbitrary high level of certainty . it seems fair to say that there is a fairly widespread disinterest in hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis because it is widely believed ( and i will assume it is true here for the sake of argument ) that the available evidence for nostratic falls short of this imaginary level of certainty which deserves the label "" proven "" . a common type of reaction to unproven hypotheses is that it has not been demonstrated that the observed similarities might not be due to chance and / or borrowing . but suppose that someone were to take the same attitude towards comparative reconstruction of protolanguages . suppose that someone were to object to comparative reconstruction of anything but very shallow groups on the grounds that one can never prove that the reconstructions are correct . just as one can object to certain claims of genetic relationships on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility that the observed similarities might be due to accident and / or borrowing , one could equally well object to virtually all hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . the comparative method is a way to come up with the best guess one can make about a protolanguage ; it never provides proof that the reconstruction is in fact correct . so why bother doing it ? the answer should be obvious : hypotheses which represent our best guesses at any point in time are what much of science is about . by why do so many linguists seem to object to applying the same way of thinking to hypotheses about genetic relationships ? why is it that many historical linguists find the hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis either laughable or upsetting ? why do n't they react the same way to comparative reconstructions , since they also are "" unproven "" ? why do n't they rush out and read everything they can find on nostratic and conclude "" the evidence is tantalizing but not conclusive ; it 's a really exciting hypothesis "" ? why is there such a double standard ? i want to suggest an answer to this question , an answer which , if right , provides insight into the nature of many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses of genetic relationship . namely , some people find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart from any detailed historical work that plays a role in supporting hypotheses . other people , however , are primarily interested in the detailed historical work itself , and do not find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , but only interesting in so far as they are an inevitable consequence of historical work . people of the first sort are more likely to find recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while people of the latter sort are unlikely to react that way , unless they are penutian specialists . as one moves back in time , the ability to apply the comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , and detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( and to many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . but at any time depth , we can always be much more confident of the genetic classification than we can of any comparative reconstructions . our confidence in indo - european as a language family is surely greater than our confidence in any specific claims about proto - indo - european . but as we move further back in time , we should expect there to be hypotheses that we cannot be entirely confident of , but for which there is at least some promising evidence , where any comparative reconstruction is going to be sufficiently speculative as to not be satisfying to linguists interested in traditional comparative work . and since these linguists are not interested in genetic classification except as a biproduct of detailed historical work , such linguists are likely to find the hypotheses uninteresting . on the other hand , for linguists who find questions of genetic classification inherently interesting , the fact that detailed historical work may not be possible is irrelevant , and the fact that the hypothesis is unproven or unprovable may be no more a source of concern than the fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven and unprovable . if this view is correct , much of the debate surrounding controversial hypotheses in genetic classification is based , not on substantive questions , but simply on what sorts of questions different people find interesting . matthew dryer\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

international philosophical preprint exchange 's collection , including the abstracts and tables of contents of an increasing number of philosophical journals , is now available via mosaic and the world wide web . our www server is still under development and is changing rapidly , and at the moment there are still several rough spots , but access to all the ippe materials is in place . due to the rich interface provided by the web , browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe 's structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last "" news from the ippe "" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of "" minimal refereeing "" by the ippe 's international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe 's large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same "" minimal refereeing "" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october 's joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe 's board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange 's ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141df1,"Subject: third international icsc symposia\n \n third international icsc symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / iia99 . htm and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) http : / / www . icsc . ab . ca / soco99 . htm june 1 - 4 , 1999 at the palazzo ducale in genova , italy introduction the international symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend to encompass short-to - long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141dff,"Subject: "" syntax and the comparative method\n \n concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i ' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the 'd aughter ' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative ' mother ' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling 's book : man 's many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world 's population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous ' sprachbunds ' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n't even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are ' related ' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n't be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek ' colonies ' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain ' areal ' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can't really speak of the ' oddity ' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means ' odd ' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia ' langauges ' , would n't we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n't vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the ' parent ' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can ' prove ' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the ' unlikely ' correspondences ( i . e . ' ist / sind ' and ' est / sunt ' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141e05,"Subject: re : check this out !\n \n dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !\n",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1

( b ) predeliction to pig latin - type language game covers a much wider age bracket than i had initially suspected , beginning at around 10 years , and overlapping with youth slang , in which pig latin - type expressions may be taken up as slang - specific words . thanks again to everybody who contributed . perhaps i should apologize that this summary got so long , but to be honest , of course , i am very happy to have gotten so much to summarize , and thought it would be selfish not to share it with fellow linguist - listers and future searchers of the linguist archives . for this same reason , here are my own experiences with pig latin : at age 12-13 years , in indonesian junior middle school ( smp ) in bogor , west java , i encountered ( took part ) in the following form of pig latin : sentences were constructed to preferentially consist of bisyllabic words ( most basic words in indonesian are bisyllabic ) , and when the first syllable ended in a consonant , the entire second syllable was replaced by _ se _ ( _ e _ as in english "" were "" ) , otherwise the initial consonant of the second syllable was retained and only the rest replaced : _ saya cinta sama kamu _ "" i love you "" ( _ c _ as engl . _ ch _ ) became : _ sayse cinse samse kamse _ from other people i know that similar indonesian pig latins had existed in other parts of indonesia , particularly in central and east java . most of the ones i heard of had the _ se _ insertion , but the rules were not always exactly like in bogor in my childhood . it was only used occasionally , particularly to tease those who were not "" in "" to the secret . it was a passing fad which lasted not even as long as one school year . finally , i understand that some time around 10 years ago , in israelian pop-music there had been a hit , which also became popular outside israel , particularly in west europe . the title seems to have meant "" i love you "" in pig latin - style manipulated hebrew . can anyone tell me anything of that song , but particularly of the hebrew pig latin ? does anyone know anything about pig latin e . g . in chinese , hindi , tamil , arabic , turkish , or suaheli ? does youth slang exist in amerindian languages , in australian aborigine , or other languages of pre-industrial communities ? best regards to all , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdi tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdi @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141e14,"Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC \nprocess.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required \nactions.  If you have questions, please contact me.\n\nDecember 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director \nand below positions.\nJanuary 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All \nperformance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, \nmust be communicated to employees.\nFebruary 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.\n\nSince we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following \ninformation and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is \nvery proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people \navailable in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  \nThe challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most \naccurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and \nprogress in their current roles and within the company.\n\nThere are basically two objectives to our performance review system.\n\nCareer Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance \nreview system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following \nfour documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, \nAccomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to \naccomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments \nsince the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a \nlist of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the \ncornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.\n\nPerformance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine \npromotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC \n(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA \nmanagement team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to \nmake this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading \nemployees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities \ndefined in the ""Expectations"" document.  Performance is also gauged relative \nto your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's \nmanager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented \neach person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel \nconfident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our \noffice were acknowledged.\n\nThe following is a review of the various rating categories.\n\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of \nthe criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.\n\nSATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the \ncriteria.  Further development needed in many areas.\n\nSTRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of \nthe criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.\n\nEXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  \nFurther development needs are minimal.\n\nSUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for \ncriteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.\n\nMy commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your \ncareer/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this \ninformation aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any \nquestions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy \nFitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide \nassistance with the PRC Process.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141e1b,"INDIVIDUAL.COM\n\nHere's an article recommended by: Karen Denne\nand it comes to you via Individual.com, Inc.\n\nThe following message was attached:\n\n\nHERE IS THE STORY WE WERE REQUESTED TO SEND YOU\n\nThis story appeared on http://www.individual.com December 7, 2000\n_________________________________________________________\n\nUnder TURN Proposal Electric Rates Could Be Held at 5 Cents a KWH\n\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 6, 2000 via NewsEdge Corporation  -\nAn immediate way to\nget electric rates under control was offered today by TURN, the\nUtility Reform Network. The plan, included in a report titled ""The 5\nCent Plan for California's Energy Crisis,"" would keep electricity\naffordable while larger, long-range reforms are contemplated. Under\nthe proposal, the utilities would be required to sell consumers\nelectricity at the rate of 5 cents per kwh. Unlike utility proposals\ncalling for increases of up to 35%, TURN's proposal would hold rates\nat or below current levels.\n\n\n""The time for debate about deregulation is over,"" said Nettie\nHoge, executive director of TURN, the Utility Reform Network. ""The\ntime for action is here, and the bottom line is no rate increases.""\n\n\nTURN's plan, like Governor Davis', requires that the utilities\nstop selling off their generation assets. But under TURN's proposal,\nthe profits from those electrical generation facilities, which were\npaid for by ratepayers, would benefit ratepayers. Rates for\nresidential customers would be cost-based, with large commercial and\nindustrial customers free to broker their own deals.\n\n\n""Now that California's deregulation experiment has blown up in our\nfaces, consumers expect action from their elected representatives, who\nforced deregulation on us despite widespread opposition,"" Hoge said.\n""While looking at a long range strategy to get us out of the mess they\ncreated, leaders can easily implement these reforms guaranteeing that\nconsumers will pay no more than 5 cents a kwh for the electricity they\nneed.""\n\n\nTURN's proposals include:\n\n\n--  Electricity provided to residential and small business\n\n\ncustomers at 5 cents per kwh.\n\n\n--  Utility companies retain their remaining electric generation\n\n\nfacilities, and the revenues from the sale of that electricity\n\n\nare credited primarily to ratepayers, not shareholders.\n\n\n--  Utilities increase use of long-term contract for purchasing\n\n\npower -- but purchases over the 5-cent benchmark would be\n\n\npresumed unreasonable.\n\n\n--  Utilities required to include renewables in their residential\n\n\npower purchases.\n\n\nHoge said if the utilities are unwilling to provide residential\nelectric service at the reasonable price proposed by TURN, the state\nshould create a new public power entity, ""CalPower,"" and charge it\nwith the responsibility of serving residential customers. ""We are\ntired of being guinea pigs,"" Hoge said. ""Consumers can't pay their\nelectric bills with promises that deregulation will work. We need\nreasonable rates and we need them now.""\n\n\nThe report, and charts contrasting the utilities' proposed rate\nhikes with TURN's proposed reforms, are available on our Web site at\nwww.turn.org/turnarticles/news.\n\n\n\nCONTACT: TURN |              Bob Finkelstein, 415/929-8876, ext. 301 | Mind=\ny=20\nSpatt, 415/929-8876, ext. 306\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nIndividual.com is the #1 provider of free, individualized news\nand information to business people over the Internet.

64e394aa5c0aa5be4e141e24,"The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the \nSacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a \nlawsuit against FERC.\n?\nJohn Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the \nSacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, \nwhich he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, \nthe Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural \nResources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One \ncolumnist commented that Burton would ""love it to death,"" meaning it would  \nget so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)\n?\nThe MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? \nHe said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.\n?\nBurton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said ""some  people"" say it \ndoesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the \nfollowing would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:\n?\n\nBack debt must be verified;\nAll creditors must take a 30% ""haircut"";\nThe transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to \nwhat the governor has mentioned;\n$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.\n\n?\nWhen asked whether $400 million was enough, he said ""no"" and  that he feels \nthe parent should pay ""a ton.""? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated \nrate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if \nelectricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop \nto $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of \ncash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate \ncomponent. \n?\nBurton called?the dedicated rate component a ""big  problem"" and said it could \nbe the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.\n?\nHe said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should \nset an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? \nthis is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk \nshows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is \ngoing to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this \nis one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, \n""You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later \nyou're over it and your stomach's OK.""\n?\nBurton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the \nsituation should be handled:? ""The only way to deal with  exploiters is to \nterrorize the bastards.""\n?\nAsked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the \nMOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there \nare allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.\n?\n?\nLAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE\n?\nShortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a \nlawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the \nNinth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this \nafternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  \nadditional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.\n?\nThe plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob \nHertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of \nOakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, \natty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark \nKelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  \nFigueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? \n?\nThe suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.\n?\nBurton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its \nstatutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added \nthat FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for \nCalifornians' relief.\n?\nJoe Cotchett said the suit is ""very basic"" and is based on the  Federal Power \nAct, which he says limits power costs to ""fair and justifiable""  rates.??A \nprimary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  ""health and welfare"" and \npublic safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and \n12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? \nHe said it is ""not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, \ndisabled kids and convalescent facilities.""? Today  also happened to be the \nlegislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the \nnursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently \nasked to sit at the back of the room for effect.\n?\nCotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities \nto exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility \n(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line \nand substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been \nsealed.\n?\nHe cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this \nsummer, which could mean four hours a day.?

We \nenjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with \nEnron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as \nwell.\n\nWe wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and \nadditional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January \n19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We \nplan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are \nconsidering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either\n(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to \nserve retail customers, OR\n(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas \nfor further investments.\n\nHowever, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy \nServices before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to \nsuggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; \nso please let us know.\n\nWe have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but \nhere are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:\n\nCan we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is \nin the annual report?\nWhat is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?\nWho are the customers and how are they acquired?\nWhat would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?\nWhat are the international expansion plans and capabilities?\nIs there any important regulatory summary information we can have?\n\nIf this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, \nwill you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?\n\nAfter we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to \nschedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly \ninvolved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in \nthe new year to discuss this further.
