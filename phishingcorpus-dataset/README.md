**IMPORTANT**: this file is not included in the git repository as it is quarantined by windows on download, it's available in my [fork](https://github.com/Twigonometry/MachineLearningPhishing) in case the original goes down. If you do grab the file on a Windows machine, you can add an exemption to Defender. Or you can download the file on an Ubuntu machine

The "phishingcorpus" dataset from Fette et. al's paper 'Learning to Detect Phishing Emails' has been reproduced [here](https://github.com/diegoocampoh/MachineLearningPhishing/blob/master/code/resources/emails-phishing.mbox). To install it:

```bash
$ cd phishingcorpus-dataset
$ wget https://github.com/Twigonometry/MachineLearningPhishing/raw/master/code/resources/emails-phishing.mbox -O emails-phishing.mbox
```

It's quite old, so the sophistication of phishing has undoubtedly advanced since then, but it's a start.
